Assignment 12 for MMC6278 - Create an ES6 Class


## Issues While Completing Assignment
The most difficult portion I had with this was the coding for performMaintenance. It took me a while to figure out I had to put it into a function to make it work properly.

The next part I had difficultly with is the "should have had a 3 second maintenance and log "maintenance complete" after honking." I never was able to figure out how to make that go away.
